1- What output do you get from the program? Why?

    Output :

    Atomic Counter: 2000000
    Normal Counter: 1370534

    Because atomic instructions are single instructions and cannot be divided into smaller partsthis feature
    makes accessing and changing the value of these variables thread-safe in multi-threaded environments.

2- What is the purpose of AtomicInteger in this code?

    Since AtomicInteger guarantees atomicity, each increment will be done correctly and without interfering
    with other threads.Therefore, we expect the final value of atomicCounter to be exactly 2,000,000

3- What thread-safety guarantees does atomicCounter.incrementAndGet() provide?

    In short, atomicCounter.incrementAndGet() guarantees that:

    a- Incrementing a number is a single, complete operation.
    b- The result of this increment is immediately visible to all other threads.
    c- There will be no interference between different threads when incrementing the counter,
       and the final value of the counter will be exact.

4- In which situations would be using a lock be a better choice than an atomic variable?

    The choice between atomic variables and locks depends on the nature of the operation to be performed,
    the number of devices involved, and the need for synchronization. For simple operations on a single
    variable, atomics are better. For compound operations, protecting multiple variables, or conditional
    synchronization, locks are more powerful and appropriate tools.

5- Besides AtomicInteger, what other data types are available in the java.util.concurrent.atomic package?

    AtomicLong
    AtomicBoolean
    AtomicIntegerArray
    AtomicLongArray
    AtomicReferenceArray
    AtomicReference
    AtomicStampedReference
    AtomicMarkableReference
    AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater
    AtomicLongFieldUpdater
    AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater
    LongAdder
    DoubleAdder
    LongAccumulator
    DoubleAccumulator

The answer to the Monte Carlo algorithm question is:

    No. Sometimes, the overhead of creating too many threads can actually slow down the program. We end up wasting time on thread creation when a single-threaded execution would have been faster. As a result, while the algorithm's execution time might be shorter, the overall runtime becomes longer.
